# File created by Mathieu-Andre Chiasson and not part of the WebKitGTK+ source
# tarball. The purpose of this file is simply to get the build system going for
# building only JavaScriptCore (using -DPORT=JSCOnly) which requires this
# missing file. Adding this file makes it easy to merge new source drop into
# this repo in the future since it won't be modifying any existing file, making
# future upgrades much easier to do later on. For now, this file can remain
# empty.
